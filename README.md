The Serial Monitor is showing live actuator control status:

ðŸ”¹ Current Position = 3079
    This value comes from the position sensor (ADC input).
    It represents the actuatorâ€™s position reading.
ðŸ”¹ Current Pressure = 2958
    This value comes from the pressure sensor (ADC input).
    It represents the pressure in the system.
ðŸ”¹ Actuator: ON
    The motor is active (green LED ON).
    This means the actuator has not yet reached the defined POSITION_THRESHOLD (2000).
ðŸ”¹ PPR Valve: OPEN
    The valve status (red LED ON) is OPEN, because the pressure (2958) is below the PRESSURE_THRESHOLD (2000).
    If the pressure exceeds the threshold, the valve status would change to CLOSED.

ðŸ”¹Visual Output (LED Indicators on Board)
  Green LED (Motor LED): ON â†’ actuator running.
  Red LED (Valve LED): ON â†’ valve is open.
